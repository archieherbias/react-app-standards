# Creating a component or a screen

### Creating a screen/component of a React Web App

It is recommended to use `styled-component` to defined our components with styles rahter than using a CSS/SCSS/Less file. This way we have more control on how we defined our styles based on props.

This is the common structure of the files.

```bash
- MyComponent
---- MyComponent.js
---- styledElements.js
---- index.js
```

### Creating a screen/component of a React Native or an Expo App

This is the common structure of the files.

```bash
- MyComponent
---- MyComponent.js
---- styles.js
---- index.js
```
